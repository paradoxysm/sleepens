## Sleep Ensemble Builds

A directory for Sleep Ensemble pre-trained builds.

Currently, `sleepens` uses `joblib` to store the pre-trained builds. A limitation is that these .joblib files average 100MB. To simplify the repository and reduce clutter, pre-trained builds are released as binaries with associated releases and are not stored directly in the source code repository. Hence, the need for a directory of releases where each build can be found.
